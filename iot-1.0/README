IoT-Raspberry Pi README
------------------------

This sample program will post events emitted from Raspberry Pi and publish it to IoT cloud. 

The events that are emitted in this sample are 

1. CPU temperature
2. CPU Load
3. Simulated Sine wave to demonstrate the different events can be pushed to IoT Portal and visualized.

Steps to run the sample:

1. Run the start script using the following command 
	./start-iot.sh

2. It will print the pid and start the iot process. 

3. If you want to stop the process. Invoke the following command
	./stop-iot.sh
	
	
IoT process logs with the help of syslog. So to view the logs, go to /var/log/syslog. 


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
Please use the start-iot.sh and stop-iot.sh to start and stop the process. Unless you understand the working of this 
sample, do not directly use "iot" executable.
