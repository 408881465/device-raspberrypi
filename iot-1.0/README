iot for Debian
--------------

This sample program will post events emitted from Raspberry Pi and publish it to IoT cloud. 

The events that are emitted in this sample are 

1. CPU temperature
2. CPU Load
3. Simulated Sine wave to demonstrate the different events can be pushed to IoT Portal and visualized.

The sample depends on the iot.properties to get the values. The values are 

1. url -> The public url for the IoT message sight
2. timeinterval - > The time interval for publishing the events to the IoT cloud service.
3. tenantprefix - > The registered tenant on the IoT cloud service

Please edit the iot.properties with your configuration. 

Steps to run the sample:

1. Run the start script using the following command 
	sudo ./start-iot.sh

2. It will print the pid and start the iot process. 

3. Check the iot.log for more information on the publishing of events.

4. If you want to stop the process. Invoke the following command
	sudo ./stop-iot.sh

IMPORTANT:
----------
Please use the start-iot.sh and stop-iot.sh to start and stop the process. Unless you understand the working,
do not directly use "iot" executable.
